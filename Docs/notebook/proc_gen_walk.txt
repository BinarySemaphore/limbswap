delta magnitude is total distance changed.
1) Make sure above is distance over surface
2) Take surface distance as distance traveled over perimeter of circle
3) Use circle formula or ratios to get phase delta
4) Apply delta for coordinating feet.

For point one:
    Instead of using delta space change.
    Use space change from last ground ray cast
