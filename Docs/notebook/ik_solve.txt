Given:
We have F_n, X, Y, a, and b
X = hip location
Y = foot location
sum([a, b]) = total length of limb between hip and feet

Goal:
Find Z

c = ||Y - X||
t = arccos((c/2) / a)

q = Quaternion from t about XY cross F_n
Z = q * XY_n * a

Follow up:
1) Handle unequal segments
2) Check way without trig calls
3) Handling multiple segments between X and Y
